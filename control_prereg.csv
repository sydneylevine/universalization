The question about effect on fish population if John uses the new hooks: I took that to mean if ONLY John uses the hooks and that is how I answered basing my response on the info from the story that up to 3 people can use the hooks without harming the health of the fish population, however if John uses the hooks AND the other fishermen were fibbing about not wanting to use to the new hooks then no one knows how many are really using the hooks and the story said if 7 or more use them the fish population will collapse, so if John AND other sneaky fishermen are using the hooks then I would answer differently but I was not given definite info that the fishermen were all completely honest when they said they don't want to use the new hooks.",2
